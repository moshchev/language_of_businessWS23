Dashboard: https://language-of-business.streamlit.app

Quick Guide:
- Enter a Ticker and Click “Submit” – Waterfall Graphs should show up and you can select the time period of interest and interactively hover over the graphs to see exact data points
- Enter another Ticker in the same top field and click “Submit” - the “Comparison Mode” should pop up on the left sidebar (Top half of the sidebar is the “single mode”, bottom half the “comparison mode”)
- Now you have two companies to compare which you can select from the dropdown in the “Comparison Mode”

Notes:
-The dashboard should work for a majority of tickers, however we observed some tickers having bugs because yfinance uses a different data structure – however this is an MVP (Minimum Valuable Product) which should highlight the approach and utility of the tool
